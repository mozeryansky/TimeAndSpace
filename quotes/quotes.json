I love connecting with an audience; that is the greatest thing about going back to WWE.","author":"Dwayne Johnson"},{"quote":"If you actually keep things very organized and clutter-free, you can have more furniture than you think you can in a small space.","author":"Nate Berkus"},{"quote":"The only reason I'm an actor is that a lady pulled out of a parking space in front of a producer's office.","author":"James Garner"},{"quote":"A monkey is unaware that atoms exist. Likewise, our brainpower may not stretch to the deepest aspects of reality.

Surface, the most convincing evidence of the descent into materialism, became the focus of design. Space disappeared.","author":"Arthur Erickson"},{"quote":"The obsession with performance left no room for the development of the intuitive or spiritual impact of space and form other than the aesthetic of the machine itself.","author":"Arthur Erickson"},{"quote":"It was as though all my hostilities, anxieties, and conflicts were in one ball that was flying away into space, farther from me all the time, leaving me content with myself.","author":"Bobby Darin"},{"quote":"The reason that most British actors are better than most American actors in the end is that they don't make any money. At the very end of their lives, they get into a space movie and they make a lot of money, but until that happens, basically, they don't have bank accounts. They live from day to day.","author":"Mike Nichols"},{"quote":"It is foolish to claim, as some do, that emigration into space offers a long-term escape from Earth's problems. Nowhere in our solar system offers an environment even as clement as the Antarctic or the top of Everest.","author":"Martin Rees"},{"quote":"Most theorists suspect that space has an intricate structure - that it is 'grainy' - but that this structure is on a much finer scale than any known subatomic particle. The structure could be of an exotic kind: extra dimensions, over and above the three that we are used to (up and down, backward and forward, left and right).","author":"Martin Rees"},{"quote":"Home has always been one of the most important things. If I don't feel at home in my space, then I feel really unmoored.","author":"Nate Berkus"},{"quote":"I think the novel is not so much a literary genre, but a literary space, like a sea that is filled by many rivers. The novel receives streams of science, philosophy, poetry and contains all of these; it's not simply telling a story.","author":"Jose Saramago"},{"quote":"I'm dating myself by saying this, but I was the test audience for 'Space Invaders.' I remember when that was the first game that wasn't a pinball game. I spent a lot of money on 'Space Invaders,' in the form of quarters, of course.","author":"John C.

Hiring managers and job seekers are realizing that printing stacks of resumes is turning passe, and social media is rising as the new way of generating real-time networking opportunities.","author":"Ryan Holmes"},{"quote":"Acting is probably the greatest therapy in the world. You can get a lot stuff out of you on the set so you don't have to take it home with you at night. It's the stuff between the lines, the empty space between those lines which is interesting.","author":"Robert Carlyle"},{"quote":"I've become a workaholic. When the shows slow down and there's no press and I can get my time to myself in the studio with my music, I get into this zone, man. I enter this incredible space where I'm just making music. And I feel like I can work with anybody - with Elton John, with Hanson - and I can make something incredible.","author":"Wale"},{"quote":"I've always fantasized about being on TV. And I was. Then I fantasized about being in the movies. What could be better than captain of a space ship? I get to ride horses, shoot guns, have adventures.","author":"Nathan Fillion"},{"quote":"I've put a lot of my life into making it possible to fly in space at all.","author":"Chris Hadfield"},{"quote":"One trick, known as the journey method or 'memory palace,' is to conjure up a familiar space in the mind's eye, and then populate it with images of whatever it is you want to remember.","author":"Joshua Foer"},{"quote":"Technologists and futurists call the mashup of digital info and physical space 'blended reality.'","author":"Jamais Cascio"},{"quote":"There's definitely space for uniqueness in a home console.","author":"Shigeru Miyamoto"},{"quote":"It's always good to leave a little space between eating and lying down in bed at the end of the day. The best thing to eat at night in general is protein, fat, and vegetables. For instance, if you're in an Italian restaurant, have chicken piccata with lemon-butter sauce, lots of vegetables, and a big salad. You'll sleep like a baby.","author":"Suzanne Somers"},{"quote":"I've discovered that half the people would love to go into space and there's no need to explain it to them. The other half can't understand and I couldn't explain it to them. If someone doesn't know why, I can't explain it.","author":"Sally Ride"},{"quote":"Speaking is what most people work on. They forget the thinking and the breathing and instead try to occupy space with sound.","author":"Margaret Heffernan"},{"quote":"I believe that the only way that the human race is gonna survive is to start colonizing space and setting up colonies on the moon, and then space stations.","author":"Ace Frehley"},{"quote":"Forget the technique. Hit the guy across from you. Don't let somebody come in your space.","author":"Karl Malone"},{"quote":"Jazz is very important. It's not something I can put my finger on. When I'm writing at my favorite time, I like to have the gentle side of Coltrane or Brubeck on the CD player. It creates sort of a spiritual space in which I write best.","author":"Miller Williams"},{"quote":"In a modern loft, you can't just fill a space with furniture. Each piece has to be perfect.","author":"Nate Berkus"},{"quote":"In a small space, you want to keep the bedding as simple as possible so it looks clean, calm and collected.","author":"Nate Berkus"},{"quote":"I used to get a sort of sociophobia, and I still get it sometimes these days when I'm in a confined space with too many people. It's not like I freak out or anything, it's just that I'm far more comfortable in my own company sometimes than being surrounded by one thousand strangers.","author":"Ryan Kwanten"},{"quote":"I was always fascinated by science-fiction shows, shows like 'Star Trek' and 'Lost in Space.'","author":"Michael P. Anderson"},{"quote":"I have the infinite galaxy from '2001' as my screensaver - so if I space out while I'm writing and it goes to screensaver, I can just stare off into the stars.","author":"Eli Roth"},{"quote":"I've become convinced that Los Angeles is going to become the next contemporary art capital - no other city has more contemporary gallery space than Los Angeles. We've come into our own, finally.","author":"Eli Broad"},{"quote":"As the earth spins through space, a view from above the North Pole would encompass most of the wealth of the world - most of its food, productive machines, doctors, engineers and teachers. A view from the opposite pole would encompass most of the world's poor.","author":"Barry Commoner"},{"quote":"NASA asked me to create meals for the space shuttle. Thai chicken was the favorite. I flew in a fake space shuttle, but I have no desire to go into space after seeing the toilet.","author":"Rachael Ray"},{"quote":"People hang their hopes on you fitting into their CD collection in way that they have made a space for, but I'm playing a longer game than that.","author":"Liz Phair"},{"quote":"The first thing you must know as an actor or director is the space you will inhabit. See the architecture; imagine where things can happen in space.","author":"Robert Wilson"},{"quote":"Painting is a lie. It's the most magic of all media, the most transcendent. It makes space where there is no space.","author":"Chuck Close"},{"quote":"The Twilight Zone' wasn't around with the kids. They think going up in space is neat. Within their lifetime, there will be paying passengers on the shuttle.","author":"Christa McAuliffe"},{"quote":"It takes a while to master the art of hammock-lounging. At first I could only manage five minutes or so before I thought I ought to get out and go and help a child learn how to swim or something. But after observing the Mexicans' capability for staring into space for hours on end, I decided to put in some proper practice.","author":"Tom Hodgkinson"},{"quote":"I credit Google for having the foresight to identify threats to its main business of selling advertising against search results. The potential loss of market share in the mobile space led them to the Android acquisition.","author":"Barry Ritholtz"},{"quote":"And then finally, I'm the commander, so I am fundamentally responsible for the lives of the other people on board and the health and longevity of the space station. I need to bring six people back happy, healthy and feeling like they've had the best six months of their life.","author":"Chris Hadfield"},{"quote":"Kickstarter eliminates the risk that publishers and booksellers face. They have limited resources and limited shelf space, and Kickstarter is proof to them that something is going to work.","author":"Seth Godin"},{"quote":"I feel like there's a lot of noise in the social space. The Vines and Instagrams of the world are gaining traction, and their solutions are perfect for their communities.","author":"Chad Hurley"},{"quote":"Nearly everybody I know does something to try to remove herself to clear her head and to have enough time and space to think... All of us instinctively feel that something inside us is crying out for more spaciousness and stillness to offset the exhilarations of this movement and the fun and diversion of the modern world.","author":"Pico Iyer"},{"quote":"Humans are vulnerable, messy little animals and that's normal. And all I want to do is make a space for that in my films.","author":"Mike Mills"},{"quote":"Absolute space, that is to say, the mark to which it would be necessary to refer the earth to know whether it really moves, has no objective existence.","author":"Henri Poincare"},{"quote":"My greatest strength as a child, I realize now, was my imagination.

When we consider the nerve impulses entering the brain, we realize that they are not woven together automatically, any more than the information is inside a computer.","author":"Robert Lanza"},{"quote":"Being a pop fan is a lot like Catholic devotion - lots of ritual, lots of ceremony... We touch the icon to enter the sacred space, genuflecting to reliquaries and ostentatoria that make something splendid of our most secret desires and agonies.","author":"Rob Sheffield"},{"quote":"Even in making objects, as soon as you start to get the feeling that some form of craft is coming into place, you realize that everything is wrong. Because craft is really just a fetish. It is wasted energy. It's about the object, some space which has nothing to do with the human.","author":"Jeff Koons"},{"quote":"I quickly learned that asking if an interview space was wheelchair accessible was a bad idea; it gave a potential employer an immediate bad impression.

And I think if there's anything artistic, it's in that middle space.","author":"Anna Deavere Smith"},{"quote":"Why is there space rather than no space? Why is space three-dimensional? Why is space big? We have a lot of room to move around in. How come it's not tiny? We have no consensus about these things. We're still exploring them.","author":"Leonard Susskind"},{"quote":"There is no public space for women; the whole world is a prison where you have to be constantly aware at all times that you're a potential victim.

It's a big broad valley with a river flowing through it, and you can see the wine-making dryness of the land.","author":"Chris Hadfield"},{"quote":"The beauty of the space station, and of human spaceflight, is that it is now at a level of maturity where you can invite people on-board, which is what I worked so hard to do on social media and all the videos I made.","author":"Chris Hadfield"},{"quote":"I try not to play two days in succession.

I watch his performance today and he still makes me laugh.","author":"Mark Goddard"},{"quote":"I often feel newspapers are just filling up space. Of course, I also know people who write really long books.","author":"Vikram Seth"},{"quote":"Everyone who's in America spends the first few years not experiencing it.

It was a big special effects film, and I wasn't crazy about pretending I was in outer space. It feels ridiculous.","author":"Steve Buscemi"},{"quote":"I always liked the visuals to be choice and at the same time minimalist. And, I love black boxes.

That is why a writer often needs space and time, so that he or she can abandon ordinary life and 'live' with the characters.","author":"Margaret Mahy"},{"quote":"Perhaps the best motivation for going to Mars is political.
